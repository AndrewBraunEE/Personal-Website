<!-- This is the about me section -->
<p1> I'm Andrew Braun! I'm currently a student studying Electrical Engineering at UCLA. Currently, I am looking for co-op and internship opportunities
either in CS or Electrical Engineering.

In my free time, I like to run, play guitar, hack up my own personal projects, fly my drone, among a multitude of other things.
